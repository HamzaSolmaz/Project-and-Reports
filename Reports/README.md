## 2 Player Fighting Game on FPGA
  A real-time 2-player fighting game implemented on FPGA using Verilog HDL. Features directional movement, attack/block mechanics, collision detection, and FSM-based game logic. Runs at 60 Hz with 640×480 VGA output, physical keypad controls, and visual feedback via VGA, LEDs, and 7-segment display. Includes PvP and bot modes.

## Dc Motor Drive
  Design and simulation of a controlled driver for a DC motor powered by a single- or three-phase AC source. Converts AC to an adjustable DC output (up to 180 V) and implements a closed-loop speed controller. Focuses on non-idealities, drive topology selection, and real-time control for industrial applications.

## Optical Wireless Communication System
  An optical communication system using an IR LED for transmission and a photodiode for reception. Includes microphone input, AGC, filters, amplifiers, and RGB LED signal strength indicator. Offers stable audio transmission and reliable performance, bridging theory and practical circuit design.
